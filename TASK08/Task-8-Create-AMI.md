# üåü Task 8 - Create AMI Using Terraform

## üìå Task Description

The **Nautilus DevOps team** is strategizing the migration of a portion of their infrastructure to the **AWS cloud**. Recognizing the scale of this undertaking, they have opted to approach the migration in incremental steps rather than as a single massive transition. To achieve this, they have segmented large tasks into smaller, more manageable units.

This granular approach enables the team to execute the migration in gradual phases, ensuring smoother implementation and minimizing disruption to ongoing operations. By breaking down the migration into smaller tasks, the Nautilus DevOps team can systematically progress through each stage, allowing for better control, risk mitigation, and optimization of resources throughout the migration process.

**Requirements:**
- Create an AMI from an existing EC2 instance named **`datacenter-ec2`**
- Name of the AMI should be **`datacenter-ec2-ami`**
- Make sure AMI is in **available** state
- The Terraform working directory is **`/home/bob/terraform`**
- Update the **`main.tf`** file (do not create a separate .tf file)

üëâ **Your task:** Create a custom Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from an existing EC2 instance to enable consistent instance deployments with pre-configured settings.

üí° **Note:** AMIs allow you to create reusable snapshots of configured instances for rapid deployment and scaling.

---

## üîß Infrastructure Overview

**Target Environment:** AWS Cloud (default region)
**Provider:** AWS (Amazon Web Services)
**Resources:** 
- EC2 Instance (datacenter-ec2) as the source for AMI creation
- AMI created from running instance with custom configurations
- Available state AMI ready for launching new instances

**Working Directory:** `/home/bob/terraform`

---

## üìã Solution Overview

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Components
- **Source EC2 Instance:** The datacenter-ec2 instance that serves as the template
- **AMI from Instance Resource:** Creates an AMI snapshot from the running instance
- **Image State Management:** Ensures AMI reaches available state for deployment
- **Instance Template:** Reusable image for consistent deployments

### üéØ Implementation Strategy
1. Ensure source EC2 instance (datacenter-ec2) exists and is running
2. Create AMI from the existing instance using aws_ami_from_instance resource
3. Configure proper naming for the AMI (datacenter-ec2-ami)
4. Wait for AMI to reach available state for usage

---

## üöÄ Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Navigate to Working Directory
```bash
cd /home/bob/terraform
```

**Purpose:** Ensure we're working in the correct Terraform directory as specified in the requirements.

---

### Step 2: Update Main Terraform Configuration

Update the `main.tf` file with the complete solution:
```hcl
# main.tf

# Provision EC2 instance (source for AMI creation)
resource "aws_instance" "ec2" {
  ami           = "ami-0c101f26f147fa7fd"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  vpc_security_group_ids = [
    "sg-89060491a8db79a22"
  ]
  
  tags = {
    Name = "datacenter-ec2"
  }
}

# Create AMI from the EC2 instance
resource "aws_ami_from_instance" "datacenter_ec2_ami" {
  name               = "datacenter-ec2-ami"
  source_instance_id = aws_instance.ec2.id
}
```

**Configuration Breakdown:**
- `aws_instance` - Source EC2 instance that will be used to create the AMI
- `aws_ami_from_instance` - Creates AMI from specified source instance
- `source_instance_id` - References the EC2 instance ID for AMI creation
- `name` - Required AMI name as specified in requirements

---

### Step 3: Initialize Terraform (if needed)
```bash
terraform init
```

**Purpose:** Initialize Terraform if not already done, ensuring all required providers are available.

**Expected Output:**
```
Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Reusing previous version of hashicorp/aws from the dependency lock file
- Using previously-installed hashicorp/aws v5.20.0

Terraform has been successfully initialized!
```

---

### Step 4: Format and Validate Configuration
```bash
# Format the configuration
terraform fmt

# Validate the configuration
terraform validate
```

**Purpose:** Ensure code formatting consistency and validate syntax correctness.

**Expected Output:**
```
Success! The configuration is valid.
```

---

### Step 5: Plan and Apply Configuration
```bash
# Review the execution plan
terraform plan

# Apply the configuration
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_ami_from_instance.datacenter_ec2_ami will be created

## üîç Code Analysis

### Complete Configuration (`main.tf`)
```hcl
# Provision EC2 instance (source for AMI creation)
resource "aws_instance" "ec2" {
  ami           = "ami-0c101f26f147fa7fd"        # Base Amazon Linux AMI
  instance_type = "t2.micro"                     # Instance size
  vpc_security_group_ids = [
    "sg-89060491a8db79a22"                      # Specific security group ID
  ]
  
  tags = {
    Name = "datacenter-ec2"                      # Required instance name
  }
}

# Create AMI from the EC2 instance
resource "aws_ami_from_instance" "datacenter_ec2_ami" {
  name               = "datacenter-ec2-ami"      # Required AMI name
  source_instance_id = aws_instance.ec2.id      # Reference to source instance
}
```

### AMI Creation Process
1. **Instance Preparation:** Source instance must be in "running" or "stopped" state
2. **Snapshot Creation:** AWS creates EBS snapshots of all attached volumes
3. **AMI Registration:** AWS registers the AMI with the snapshots
4. **State Transition:** AMI moves from "pending" to "available" state
5. **Ready for Use:** AMI can be used to launch new instances

### Resource Dependencies
```
aws_instance.ec2 (source instance)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ aws_ami_from_instance.datacenter_ec2_ami
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ depends on aws_instance.ec2.id
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ waits for instance to be ready
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue 1: Source instance not ready**
- **Symptoms:** Error: "InvalidInstanceID.NotFound" or instance not ready
- **Solution:** Ensure source instance exists and is in running state
```bash
# Check instance state
aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids <instance-id> --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].State.Name'

# Wait for instance to be running before creating AMI
```

**Issue 2: AMI creation takes long time**
- **Symptoms:** AMI remains in "pending" state for extended period
- **Solution:** AMI creation can take 10-20 minutes, especially for larger instances
```bash
# Monitor AMI creation progress
aws ec2 describe-images --image-ids <ami-id> --query 'Images[0].State'

# Check for any errors in AMI creation
aws ec2 describe-images --image-ids <ami-id> --query 'Images[0].StateReason'
```

**Issue 3: AMI name already exists**
- **Symptoms:** Error: "InvalidAMIName.Duplicate"
- **Solution:** AMI names must be unique within your account
```bash
# Check existing AMIs with similar names
aws ec2 describe-images --owners self --filters "Name=name,Values=datacenter-ec2-ami"

# Use unique naming or import existing AMI
```

**Issue 4: Insufficient permissions**
- **Symptoms:** Error: "UnauthorizedOperation"
- **Solution:** Ensure IAM permissions for AMI operations
```bash
# Required permissions:
# - ec2:CreateImage
# - ec2:DescribeImages
# - ec2:DescribeInstances
# - ec2:DescribeSnapshots
```

**Issue 5: Security group not found**
- **Symptoms:** Error: "InvalidGroupId.NotFound"
- **Solution:** Verify security group ID exists in the VPC
```bash
# Check if security group exists
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids sg-89060491a8db79a22
```

---

## üöÄ Production Considerations

### AMI Management Strategy
- **Version Control:** Implement AMI versioning with date/build stamps
- **Automated Building:** Use CI/CD pipelines to create AMIs automatically
- **Testing:** Validate AMIs before production deployment
- **Cleanup:** Regular cleanup of old AMIs to manage costs
- **Cross-Region:** Copy AMIs to multiple regions for disaster recovery

### AMI Best Practices
```bash
# Production AMI considerations:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Security Updates: Keep base images updated
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Application Pre-installation: Bake in common software
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Configuration Management: Use tools like Ansible/Chef
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Image Testing: Automated validation of AMI functionality
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Documentation: Maintain AMI change logs and documentation
```

### Cost Management
- **Snapshot Costs:** AMIs incur costs for underlying EBS snapshots
