# 🌟 Task 12 - Create Public S3 Bucket Using Terraform

## 📌 Task Description

As part of the data migration process, the **Nautilus DevOps team** is actively creating several S3 buckets on AWS. They plan to utilize both private and public S3 buckets to store the relevant data. Given the ongoing migration of other infrastructure to AWS, it is logical to consolidate data storage within the AWS environment as well.

This task focuses on creating a public S3 bucket that will be accessible for public data storage and distribution as part of the comprehensive data migration strategy.

**Requirements:**
- Create a public S3 bucket named **`xfusion-s3-13513`**
- Ensure the bucket is **accessible publicly** by setting proper ACL
- Create resources only in the **us-east-1** region
- The Terraform working directory is **`/home/bob/terraform`**
- Create the **`main.tf`** file (do not create a different .tf file)
- Use ACL settings to ensure public accessibility

👉 **Your task:** Create a publicly accessible S3 bucket using Terraform with proper configuration for public data access.

💡 **Note:** Public S3 buckets require careful configuration of ACLs and public access block settings to enable public accessibility.

## 🔧 Infrastructure Overview

**Target Environment:** AWS Cloud (us-east-1 region)
**Provider:** AWS (Amazon Web Services)
**Resources:** 
- S3 Bucket with public access configuration
- Bucket ACL set to public-read
- Public Access Block settings configured for public access

**Working Directory:** `/home/bob/terraform`

---

## 📋 Solution Overview

### 🏗️ Architecture Components
- **S3 Bucket Resource:** Creates the main storage bucket with specified name
- **S3 Bucket ACL:** Configures public-read access control list
- **Public Access Block:** Disables restrictions to allow public access
- **Regional Configuration:** Deployed specifically in us-east-1 region

### 🎯 Implementation Strategy
1. Create S3 bucket with the specified name (xfusion-s3-13513)
2. Configure bucket ACL to public-read for public accessibility
3. Disable public access block restrictions
4. Ensure proper tagging for resource identification

---

## 🚀 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Navigate to Working Directory
```bash
cd /home/bob/terraform
```

**Purpose:** Ensure we're working in the correct Terraform directory as specified in the requirements.

---

### Step 2: Create Main Terraform Configuration

Create the `main.tf` file with the complete solution:
```hcl
# main.tf

# Create S3 bucket for public data storage
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "xfusion_bucket" {
  bucket = "xfusion-s3-13513"
  
  tags = {
    Name = "xfusion-s3-13513"
  }
}

# Configure bucket ACL for public read access
resource "aws_s3_bucket_acl" "xfusion_bucket_acl" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.xfusion_bucket.id
  acl    = "public-read"
}

# Disable public access block to allow public access
resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "xfusion_bucket_public_access" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.xfusion_bucket.id
  
  block_public_acls       = false
  block_public_policy     = false
  ignore_public_acls      = false
  restrict_public_buckets = false
}
```

**Configuration Breakdown:**
- `aws_s3_bucket` - Creates the S3 bucket with specified name
- `aws_s3_bucket_acl` - Sets ACL to "public-read" for public accessibility
- `aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block` - Disables all public access restrictions
- `tags` - Proper resource identification and management

---

### Step 3: Initialize Terraform
```bash
terraform init
```

**Purpose:** Initialize the Terraform working directory and download the AWS provider.

**Expected Output:**
```
Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding latest version of hashicorp/aws...
- Installing hashicorp/aws v5.20.0...
- Using previously-installed hashicorp/aws v5.20.0

Terraform has been successfully initialized!
```

---

### Step 4: Format and Validate Configuration
```bash
# Format the configuration
terraform fmt

# Validate the configuration
terraform validate
```

**Purpose:** Ensure code formatting consistency and validate syntax correctness.

**Expected Output:**
```
Success! The configuration is valid.
```

---

### Step 5: Plan and Apply Configuration
```bash
# Review the execution plan
terraform plan

# Apply the configuration
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_s3_bucket.xfusion_bucket will be created
  + resource "aws_s3_bucket" "xfusion_bucket" {
      + acceleration_status         = (known after apply)

      + tags                       = {
          + "Name" = "xfusion-s3-13513"
        }
      + tags_all                   = {
          + "Name" = "xfusion-s3-13513"
        }
      + website_domain             = (known after apply)
      + website_endpoint           = (known after apply)
    }

  # aws_s3_bucket_acl.xfusion_bucket_acl will be created
  + resource "aws_s3_bucket_acl" "xfusion_bucket_acl" {
      + acl    = "public-read"
      + bucket = (known after apply)
      + id     = (known after apply)
    }

  # aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block.xfusion_bucket_public_access will be created
  + resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "xfusion_bucket_public_access" {
      + block_public_acls       = false
      + block_public_policy     = false
      + bucket                  = (known after apply)
      + id                      = (known after apply)
      + ignore_public_acls      = false
      + restrict_public_buckets = false
    }

Plan: 3 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Apply complete! Resources: 3 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue 1: Bucket name already exists**
- **Symptoms:** Error: "BucketAlreadyExists"
- **Solution:** S3 bucket names must be globally unique
```bash
# Try with a different suffix or use random naming
resource "random_id" "bucket_suffix" {
  byte_length = 4
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "xfusion_bucket" {
  bucket = "xfusion-s3-13513-${random_id.bucket_suffix.hex}"
  # ... rest of configuration
}
```

**Issue 2: Public access blocked by account settings**
- **Symptoms:** Public access settings don't take effect
- **Solution:** Check account-level public access block settings
```bash
# Check account-level settings
aws s3control get-public-access-block --account-id <account-id>

# May need to modify account-level restrictions
```

**Issue 3: ACL configuration conflicts**
- **Symptoms:** Error applying public-read ACL
- **Solution:** Ensure public access block is disabled first
```bash
# Verify the order of resource creation in Terraform
# Public access block should be configured before ACL
```

**Issue 4: Region-specific bucket access**
- **Symptoms:** Bucket not accessible from expected region
- **Solution:** Verify bucket is created in us-east-1
```bash
# Check bucket region
aws s3api get-bucket-location --bucket xfusion-s3-13513
```

## 💡 Best Practices Applied

- **🔐 Access Control:** Proper configuration of public access settings
- **📊 Resource Management:** Structured resource dependencies and references
- **🏷️ Naming Conventions:** Consistent naming matching requirements
- **🔄 Public Configuration:** Comprehensive public access enablement
- **📍 Regional Strategy:** Explicit deployment in us-east-1 region

---

## 🚀 Production Considerations

### Security and Access Management
- **Least Privilege:** Consider if full public access is necessary
- **Bucket Policies:** Implement more granular bucket policies if needed
- **CloudFront Integration:** Use CloudFront for better performance and security
- **Access Logging:** Enable S3 access logging for audit trails
- **Versioning:** Consider enabling versioning for data protection

### Public Bucket Best Practices
```hcl
# Enhanced public bucket configuration
resource "aws_s3_bucket_versioning" "versioning" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.xfusion_bucket.id
  versioning_configuration {
    status = "Enabled"
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration" "encryption" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.xfusion_bucket.id
  
  rule {
    apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {
      sse_algorithm = "AES256"
    }
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_logging" "access_logging" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.xfusion_bucket.id
  
  target_bucket = "access-logs-bucket"
  target_prefix = "access-logs/"
}
```

### Cost Management
- **Lifecycle Policies:** Implement lifecycle rules to manage storage costs
- **Storage Classes:** Use appropriate storage classes for different data types
- **Transfer Costs:** Monitor data transfer costs for public buckets
- **Request Costs:** Track GET/PUT request costs for high-traffic buckets
