# üåü Task 14 - Create IAM User Using Terraform

## üìå Task Description

When establishing infrastructure on the AWS cloud, **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** is among the first and most critical services to configure. IAM facilitates the creation and management of user accounts, groups, roles, policies, and other access controls. The **Nautilus DevOps team** is currently in the process of configuring these resources and has outlined the following requirements.

IAM users are fundamental building blocks for AWS security, providing individual identities that can be assigned specific permissions and access controls within the AWS environment.

**Requirements:**
- Create an IAM user named **`iamuser_john`** using Terraform
- The Terraform working directory is **`/home/bob/terraform`**
- Create the **`main.tf`** file (do not create a different .tf file)

üëâ **Your task:** Create an IAM user using Terraform as the foundation for identity and access management in the AWS environment.

üí° **Note:** IAM users provide individual identities for people or applications that need to interact with AWS resources.

## üîß Infrastructure Overview

**Target Environment:** AWS Cloud (global service)
**Provider:** AWS (Amazon Web Services)
**Resources:** 
- IAM User for identity management
- Foundation for access control and permissions
- Individual identity for AWS resource access

**Working Directory:** `/home/bob/terraform`

---

## üìã Solution Overview

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Components
- **IAM User Resource:** Creates an individual user identity in AWS
- **Identity Foundation:** Establishes basic identity for future permission assignments
- **Access Management:** Prepares user for policy attachments and group memberships
- **Security Framework:** Foundation for implementing least-privilege access

### üéØ Implementation Strategy
1. Create IAM user with specified name (iamuser_john)
2. Establish user identity in AWS IAM service
3. Prepare foundation for future policy and permission assignments
4. Verify user creation and accessibility

---

## üöÄ Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Navigate to Working Directory
```bash
cd /home/bob/terraform
```

**Purpose:** Ensure we're working in the correct Terraform directory as specified in the requirements.

---

### Step 2: Create Main Terraform Configuration

Create the `main.tf` file with the complete solution:
```hcl
# main.tf

# Create IAM user for identity and access management
resource "aws_iam_user" "iamuser_john" {
  name = "iamuser_john"
}
```

**Configuration Breakdown:**
- `aws_iam_user` - Creates an IAM user resource
- `name = "iamuser_john"` - Sets the required username as specified

---

### Step 3: Initialize Terraform
```bash
terraform init
```

**Purpose:** Initialize the Terraform working directory and download the AWS provider.

**Expected Output:**
```
Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding latest version of hashicorp/aws...
- Installing hashicorp/aws v5.20.0...
- Using previously-installed hashicorp/aws v5.20.0

Terraform has been successfully initialized!
```

---

### Step 4: Format and Validate Configuration
```bash
# Format the configuration
terraform fmt

# Validate the configuration
terraform validate
```

**Purpose:** Ensure code formatting consistency and validate syntax correctness.

**Expected Output:**
```
Success! The configuration is valid.
```

---

### Step 5: Plan and Apply Configuration
```bash
# Review the execution plan
terraform plan

# Apply the configuration
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_iam_user.iamuser_john will be created
  + resource "aws_iam_user" "iamuser_john" {
      + arn           = (known after apply)
      + force_destroy = false
      + id            = (known after apply)
      + name          = "iamuser_john"
      + path          = "/"
      + tags_all      = (known after apply)
      + unique_id     = (known after apply)
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

## üîç Code Analysis

### Complete Configuration (`main.tf`)
```hcl
# Create IAM user for identity and access management
resource "aws_iam_user" "iamuser_john" {
  name = "iamuser_john"                    # Required username
}
```

### IAM User Attributes
| Attribute | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| **name** | iamuser_john | The username for the IAM user |
| **path** | / | The path for the user (default root path) |
| **force_destroy** | false | Whether to force deletion when user has dependencies |
| **permissions_boundary** | null | ARN of permissions boundary policy |
| **tags** | {} | Key-value pairs for resource tagging |

### IAM User Default Properties
- **Path:** `/` (root path by default)
- **Permissions:** No permissions by default (follows least privilege)
- **Groups:** Not member of any groups initially
- **Policies:** No attached policies initially
- **Access Keys:** No access keys created by default

---

## ‚úÖ Verification Steps

### Step 1: Verify IAM User Creation
```bash
# List all Terraform managed resources
terraform state list
```

**Expected Output:**
```
aws_iam_user.iamuser_john
```

### Step 2: Check User Details in Terraform State
```bash
# Show detailed user information from Terraform state
terraform state show aws_iam_user.iamuser_john
```

**Expected Output:**
```
# aws_iam_user.iamuser_john:
resource "aws_iam_user" "iamuser_john" {
    arn           = "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/iamuser_john"
    force_destroy = false
    id            = "iamuser_john"
    name          = "iamuser_john"
    path          = "/"
    tags_all      = {}
    unique_id     = "AIDACKCEVSQ6C2EXAMPLE"
}
```

### Step 3: Verify User in AWS Console (Optional)
```bash
# List IAM users using AWS CLI
aws iam list-users --query 'Users[?UserName==`iamuser_john`]'
```

**Expected JSON Output:**
```json
[
    {
        "UserName": "iamuser_john",
        "Path": "/",
        "CreateDate": "2024-XX-XXTXX:XX:XX+00:00",
        "UserId": "AIDACKCEVSQ6C2EXAMPLE",
        "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/iamuser_john"
    }
]
```

## üß™ Testing

### Verify User Creation
```bash
# Show complete user details from Terraform state
terraform state show aws_iam_user.iamuser_john
```

### Test User Existence via AWS CLI
```bash
# Get specific user details
aws iam get-user --user-name iamuser_john
```

### Check User Permissions (Should be Empty)
```bash
# List attached user policies (should be empty)
aws iam list-attached-user-policies --user-name iamuser_john

# List inline user policies (should be empty)
aws iam list-user-policies --user-name iamuser_john
```

**Expected Output for both commands:**
```json
{
    "AttachedPolicies": []
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue 1: User already exists**
- **Symptoms:** Error: "EntityAlreadyExists"
- **Solution:** Import existing user or use different name
```bash
# Import existing user into Terraform state
terraform import aws_iam_user.iamuser_john iamuser_john

# Or use a different username
```

**Issue 2: Insufficient permissions to create IAM users**
- **Symptoms:** Error: "AccessDenied" or "UnauthorizedOperation"
- **Solution:** Ensure AWS credentials have IAM user creation permissions
```bash
# Required permissions:
# - iam:CreateUser
# - iam:GetUser
# - iam:ListUsers
# - iam:TagUser (if using tags)
```

**Issue 3: Invalid username format**
- **Symptoms:** Error: "ValidationException"
- **Solution:** Ensure username meets AWS naming requirements
```bash
# Valid characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and these symbols: + = , . @ _ -
# Maximum length: 64 characters
# Cannot start with "aws:" (reserved prefix)
```

**Issue 4: Path-related issues**
- **Symptoms:** Path validation errors
- **Solution:** Ensure path follows AWS IAM path requirements
```bash
# Path must begin and end with /
# Valid characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and / + = , . @ _ -
# Maximum length: 512 characters
```

## üí° Best Practices Applied

- **üîê Security Foundation:** Creating individual identity for access management
- **üìä Resource Management:** Simple, focused user creation following AWS standards
- **üè∑Ô∏è Naming Conventions:** Clear, descriptive username matching requirements
- **üîÑ Least Privilege:** User created with no permissions (secure default)
- **üìç Identity Strategy:** Foundation for implementing proper access controls

---

## üöÄ Production Considerations

### IAM User Security Framework
- **Multi-Factor Authentication:** Enable MFA for enhanced security
- **Access Keys:** Create programmatic access keys only when needed
- **Password Policy:** Implement strong password requirements
- **Regular Rotation:** Establish key and password rotation schedules
- **Access Review:** Regular audit of user permissions and access

### Enhanced User Configuration
```hcl
# Production-ready IAM user with comprehensive security
resource "aws_iam_user" "iamuser_john" {
  name = "iamuser_john"
  path = "/employees/"
  
  tags = {
    Name        = "John Doe"
    Department  = "DevOps"
    Team        = "Nautilus"
    Environment = "Production"
    CostCenter  = "Engineering"
  }
}

# Force MFA for console access
resource "aws_iam_user_login_profile" "john_profile" {
  user                    = aws_iam_user.iamuser_john.name
  password_reset_required = true
}

# Attach managed policy for basic access
resource "aws_iam_user_policy_attachment" "john_basic_policy" {
  user       = aws_iam_user.iamuser_john.name
  policy_arn = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/ReadOnlyAccess"
}
```

### Access Management Strategy
- **Group Membership:** Organize users into logical groups
- **Policy Attachments:** Use managed policies where possible
- **Inline Policies:** Minimize use of inline policies
- **Permissions Boundaries:** Implement boundaries for additional security
- **Monitoring:** Enable CloudTrail for user activity logging
