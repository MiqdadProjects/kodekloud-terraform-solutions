# üåü Task 11 - Create CloudWatch Alarm Using Terraform

## üìå Task Description

The **Nautilus DevOps team** is setting up monitoring in their AWS account. As part of this, they need to create a CloudWatch alarm to monitor their infrastructure and ensure optimal performance and availability.

CloudWatch alarms are essential for proactive monitoring, allowing teams to detect and respond to performance issues before they impact users or business operations.

**Requirements:**
- Create a CloudWatch alarm named **`datacenter-alarm`**
- The alarm should monitor **CPU utilization** of an EC2 instance
- Trigger the alarm when CPU utilization **exceeds 80%**
- Set the evaluation period to **5 minutes**
- Use a **single evaluation period**
- The Terraform working directory is **`/home/bob/terraform`**
- Create the **`main.tf`** file (do not create a different .tf file)

üëâ **Your task:** Implement comprehensive CloudWatch monitoring for EC2 instances to enable proactive infrastructure management.

üí° **Note:** CloudWatch alarms provide automated monitoring and can trigger actions like notifications or auto-scaling when thresholds are breached.

---

## üîß Infrastructure Overview

**Target Environment:** AWS Cloud (default region)
**Provider:** AWS (Amazon Web Services)
**Resources:** 
- EC2 Instance for monitoring target
- CloudWatch Metric Alarm for CPU utilization monitoring
- Automated threshold-based alerting system

**Working Directory:** `/home/bob/terraform`

---

## üìã Solution Overview

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Components
- **EC2 Instance:** Target instance for CPU utilization monitoring
- **CloudWatch Metric Alarm:** Monitors CPUUtilization metric from AWS/EC2 namespace
- **Threshold Configuration:** 80% CPU utilization trigger with 5-minute evaluation
- **Monitoring Integration:** Seamless integration with AWS CloudWatch service

### üéØ Implementation Strategy
1. Create EC2 instance as monitoring target
2. Configure CloudWatch alarm for CPU utilization monitoring
3. Set threshold at 80% with 5-minute evaluation period
4. Use single evaluation period for immediate alerting
5. Configure alarm parameters for production monitoring

---

## üöÄ Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Navigate to Working Directory
```bash
cd /home/bob/terraform
```

**Purpose:** Ensure we're working in the correct Terraform directory as specified in the requirements.

---

### Step 2: Create Main Terraform Configuration

Create the `main.tf` file with the complete solution:
```hcl
# main.tf

# Create EC2 instance for monitoring
resource "aws_instance" "datacenter_ec2" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"   # Placeholder AMI for LocalStack/testing
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  
  tags = {
    Name = "datacenter-ec2"
  }
}

# Create CloudWatch alarm for CPU monitoring
resource "aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm" "datacenter_alarm" {
  alarm_name          = "datacenter-alarm"
  comparison_operator = "GreaterThanThreshold"
  evaluation_periods  = 1
  metric_name         = "CPUUtilization"
  namespace           = "AWS/EC2"
  period              = 300
  statistic           = "Average"
  threshold           = 80
  alarm_description   = "This alarm triggers when CPU utilization exceeds 80%."
  actions_enabled     = false  # Disable actions since SNS may not be configured
  
  dimensions = {
    InstanceId = aws_instance.datacenter_ec2.id
  }
}
```

**Configuration Breakdown:**
- `aws_instance` - Creates target EC2 instance for monitoring
- `aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm` - Configures CPU utilization alarm
- `comparison_operator` - "GreaterThanThreshold" for exceeding 80%
- `evaluation_periods = 1` - Single evaluation period as required
- `period = 300` - 5 minutes (300 seconds) evaluation period
- `threshold = 80` - 80% CPU utilization trigger point

---

### Step 3: Initialize Terraform
```bash
terraform init
```

**Purpose:** Initialize the Terraform working directory and download required providers.

**Expected Output:**
```
Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding latest version of hashicorp/aws...
- Installing hashicorp/aws v5.20.0...
- Using previously-installed hashicorp/aws v5.20.0

Terraform has been successfully initialized!
```

---

### Step 4: Format and Validate Configuration
```bash
# Format the configuration
terraform fmt

# Validate the configuration
terraform validate
```

**Purpose:** Ensure code formatting consistency and validate syntax correctness.

**Expected Output:**
```
Success! The configuration is valid.
```

---

### Step 5: Plan and Apply Configuration
```bash
# Review the execution plan
terraform plan

# Apply the configuration
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Terraform will perform the following actions:

}
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue 1: Alarm remains in INSUFFICIENT_DATA state**
- **Symptoms:** Alarm shows INSUFFICIENT_DATA instead of OK
- **Solution:** Wait for EC2 instance to generate metrics (5-15 minutes)
```bash
# Check if instance is running and generating metrics
aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids <instance-id> --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].State.Name'

# Verify CloudWatch agent is collecting metrics
aws logs describe-log-groups --log-group-name-prefix /aws/ec2
```

**Issue 2: Invalid AMI ID error**
- **Symptoms:** Error: "InvalidAMIID.NotFound"
- **Solution:** Use valid AMI ID for your region
```bash
# Find valid Amazon Linux AMI in current region
aws ec2 describe-images --owners amazon --filters "Name=name,Values=amzn2-ami-hvm-*" --query 'Images[0].ImageId' --output text

# Update main.tf with valid AMI ID
```

**Issue 3: CloudWatch permissions error**
- **Symptoms:** Error: "UnauthorizedOperation" for CloudWatch operations
- **Solution:** Ensure IAM permissions for CloudWatch
```bash
# Required permissions:
# - cloudwatch:PutMetricAlarm
# - cloudwatch:DescribeAlarms
# - cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics
# - ec2:DescribeInstances
```

**Issue 4: Alarm not triggering**
- **Symptoms:** CPU exceeds 80% but alarm doesn't trigger
- **Solution:** Check alarm configuration and metric availability
```bash
# Verify alarm configuration
aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-names datacenter-alarm --query 'MetricAlarms[0].[ComparisonOperator,Threshold,EvaluationPeriods]'

# Check recent metric data
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics --namespace AWS/EC2 --metric-name CPUUtilization --dimensions Name=InstanceId,Value=<instance-id> --start-time $(date -u -d '1 hour ago' +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S) --end-time $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S) --period 300 --statistics Average
```

## üí° Best Practices Applied

- **üîê Monitoring Security:** Comprehensive CPU monitoring without exposing sensitive data
- **üìä Resource Management:** Efficient alarm configuration with minimal overhead
- **üè∑Ô∏è Naming Conventions:** Clear, descriptive naming for monitoring resources
- **üîÑ Threshold Management:** Appropriate 80% threshold for production workloads
- **üìç Single Point Monitoring:** Focused monitoring on specific EC2 instance

---

## üöÄ Production Considerations

### Enhanced Monitoring Strategy
- **Multiple Metrics:** Monitor memory, disk, and network alongside CPU
- **SNS Integration:** Configure alarm actions to send notifications
- **Auto Scaling:** Integrate with Auto Scaling Groups for automatic responses
- **Dashboard Creation:** Build CloudWatch dashboards for visualization
- **Log Integration:** Correlate alarms with application logs

### Alarm Actions Configuration
```hcl
# Production alarm with SNS notification
resource "aws_sns_topic" "alerts" {
  name = "infrastructure-alerts"
}

resource "aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm" "enhanced_alarm" {
  alarm_name          = "datacenter-alarm"
  comparison_operator = "GreaterThanThreshold"
  evaluation_periods  = 2                    # Multiple periods for stability
  metric_name         = "CPUUtilization"
  namespace           = "AWS/EC2"
  period              = 300
  statistic           = "Average"
  threshold           = 80
  alarm_description   = "CPU utilization exceeds 80%"
  actions_enabled     = true
  
  alarm_actions = [aws_sns_topic.alerts.arn]  # Send notifications
  ok_actions    = [aws_sns_topic.alerts.arn]  # Send recovery notifications
  
  dimensions = {
    InstanceId = aws_instance.datacenter_ec2.id
  }
}
```

### Monitoring Best Practices
- **Threshold Tuning:** Adjust thresholds based on application behavior
- **Evaluation Periods:** Use multiple periods to reduce false alarms
- **Metric Granularity:** Choose appropriate monitoring intervals
- **Cost Management:** Monitor CloudWatch costs with detailed billing
