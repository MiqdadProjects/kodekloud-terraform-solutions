# üåü Task 13 - Create Private S3 Bucket Using Terraform

## üìå Task Description

As part of the data migration process, the **Nautilus DevOps team** is actively creating several S3 buckets on AWS using Terraform. They plan to utilize both private and public S3 buckets to store the relevant data. Given the ongoing migration of other infrastructure to AWS, it is logical to consolidate data storage within the AWS environment as well.

This task focuses on creating a private S3 bucket with comprehensive security controls to ensure sensitive data remains protected and inaccessible to unauthorized public access.

**Requirements:**
- The name of the S3 bucket must be **`nautilus-s3-15729`**
- The S3 bucket must **block all public access**, making it a private bucket
- Use Terraform to provision the S3 bucket
- Ensure the resources are created in the **us-east-1** region
- The bucket must have block public access enabled to restrict any public access
- The Terraform working directory is **`/home/bob/terraform`**
- Create the **`main.tf`** file (do not create a different .tf file)

üëâ **Your task:** Create a secure, private S3 bucket with comprehensive public access restrictions using Terraform.

üí° **Note:** Private S3 buckets with blocked public access are essential for storing sensitive data and maintaining security compliance.

## üîß Infrastructure Overview

**Target Environment:** AWS Cloud (us-east-1 region)
**Provider:** AWS (Amazon Web Services)
**Resources:** 
- Private S3 Bucket with comprehensive access restrictions
- Public Access Block configuration for maximum security
- Secure data storage environment

**Working Directory:** `/home/bob/terraform`

---

## üìã Solution Overview

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Components
- **S3 Bucket Resource:** Creates the main private storage bucket
- **Public Access Block:** Enforces comprehensive public access restrictions
- **Security Configuration:** All four public access block settings enabled
- **Private Data Environment:** Secure storage for sensitive information

### üéØ Implementation Strategy
1. Create S3 bucket with the specified name (nautilus-s3-15729)
2. Configure comprehensive public access block settings
3. Ensure all public access vectors are blocked
4. Maintain private bucket security posture

---

## üöÄ Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Navigate to Working Directory
```bash
cd /home/bob/terraform
```

**Purpose:** Ensure we're working in the correct Terraform directory as specified in the requirements.

---

### Step 2: Create Main Terraform Configuration

Create the `main.tf` file with the complete solution:
```hcl
# main.tf

# Create private S3 bucket for secure data storage
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "nautilus_bucket" {
  bucket = "nautilus-s3-15729"
}

# Block all public access to ensure private bucket
resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "nautilus_block" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.nautilus_bucket.id
  
  block_public_acls       = true
  block_public_policy     = true
  ignore_public_acls      = true
  restrict_public_buckets = true
}
```

**Configuration Breakdown:**
- `aws_s3_bucket` - Creates the S3 bucket with specified name
- `aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block` - Blocks all forms of public access
- `block_public_acls = true` - Prevents public ACL configurations
- `block_public_policy = true` - Blocks public bucket policies
- `ignore_public_acls = true` - Ignores any existing public ACLs
- `restrict_public_buckets = true` - Restricts public bucket access

---

### Step 3: Initialize Terraform
```bash
terraform init
```

**Purpose:** Initialize the Terraform working directory and download the AWS provider.

**Expected Output:**
```
Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding latest version of hashicorp/aws...
- Installing hashicorp/aws v5.20.0...
- Using previously-installed hashicorp/aws v5.20.0

Terraform has been successfully initialized!
```

---

### Step 4: Format and Validate Configuration
```bash
# Format the configuration
terraform fmt

# Validate the configuration
terraform validate
```

**Purpose:** Ensure code formatting consistency and validate syntax correctness.

**Expected Output:**
```
Success! The configuration is valid.
```

---

### Step 5: Plan and Apply Configuration
```bash
# Review the execution plan
terraform plan

# Apply the configuration
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_s3_bucket.nautilus_bucket will be created
  + resource "aws_s3_bucket" "nautilus_bucket" {
      + acceleration_status         = (known after apply)
      + acl                        = (known after apply)
      + arn                        = (known after apply)
      + bucket                     = "nautilus-s3-15729"
      + bucket_domain_name         = (known after apply)
      + bucket_prefix              = (known after apply)
      + bucket_regional_domain_name = (known after apply)
      + force_destroy              = false
      + hosted_zone_id             = (known after apply)
      + id                         = (known after apply)
      + object_lock_enabled        = (known after apply)
      + policy                     = (known after apply)
      + region                     = (known after apply)
      + request_payer              = (known after apply)
      + tags_all                   = (known after apply)
      + website_domain             = (known after apply)
      + website_endpoint           = (known after apply)
    }

  # aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block.nautilus_block will be created
  + resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "nautilus_block" {
      + block_public_acls       = true
      + block_public_policy     = true
      + bucket                  = (known after apply)
      + id                      = (known after apply)
      + ignore_public_acls      = true
      + restrict_public_buckets = true
    }

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Apply complete! Resources: 2 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

## üîç Code Analysis

### Complete Configuration (`main.tf`)
```hcl
# Create private S3 bucket for secure data storage
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "nautilus_bucket" {
  bucket = "nautilus-s3-15729"              # Required bucket name
}

# Block all public access to ensure private bucket
resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "nautilus_block" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.nautilus_bucket.id # Reference to created bucket
  
  block_public_acls       = true            # Block public ACL configurations
  block_public_policy     = true            # Block public bucket policies
  ignore_public_acls      = true            # Ignore existing public ACLs
  restrict_public_buckets = true            # Restrict all public bucket access
}
```

### Public Access Block Settings Explained
| Setting | Value | Security Impact |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| **block_public_acls** | true | Prevents new public ACLs and modification of existing ones |
| **block_public_policy** | true | Blocks public bucket policies and access point policies |
| **ignore_public_acls** | true | Ignores all public ACLs on bucket and objects |
| **restrict_public_buckets** | true | Restricts access to buckets with public policies |

### Security Posture Comparison
| Configuration | Public Bucket | Private Bucket |
|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| block_public_acls | false | **true** |
| block_public_policy | false | **true** |
| ignore_public_acls | false | **true** |
| restrict_public_buckets | false | **true** |
| **Result** | Public Access | **Private & Secure** |

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue 1: Bucket name already exists**
- **Symptoms:** Error: "BucketAlreadyExists"
- **Solution:** S3 bucket names must be globally unique across all AWS accounts
```bash
# If bucket exists, either use a different name or import existing bucket
terraform import aws_s3_bucket.nautilus_bucket nautilus-s3-15729
```

**Issue 2: Public access block conflicts**
- **Symptoms:** Error applying public access block settings
- **Solution:** Ensure bucket is created first before applying access blocks
```bash
# Terraform handles dependencies automatically, but manual intervention may be needed
terraform apply -target=aws_s3_bucket.nautilus_bucket
terraform apply
```

**Issue 3: Region specification issues**
- **Symptoms:** Bucket created in wrong region
- **Solution:** Ensure AWS provider is configured for us-east-1
```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}
```

**Issue 4: Permission errors**
- **Symptoms:** "Access Denied" errors during bucket creation
- **Solution:** Verify AWS credentials have S3 permissions
```bash
# Required permissions:
# - s3:CreateBucket
# - s3:GetBucketPublicAccessBlock
# - s3:PutBucketPublicAccessBlock
# - s3:ListBucket
```

      kms_master_key_id = aws_kms_key.s3_key.arn
      sse_algorithm     = "aws:kms"
    }
    bucket_key_enabled = true
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_versioning" "versioning" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.nautilus_bucket.id
  
  versioning_configuration {
    status     = "Enabled"
    mfa_delete = "Enabled"
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_notification" "audit_notifications" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.nautilus_bucket.id
  
  cloudwatch_configuration {
    cloudwatch_configuration_id = "audit-events"
    events                      = ["s3:ObjectCreated:*", "s3:ObjectRemoved:*"]
  }
}
```

### Monitoring and Compliance
- **CloudTrail:** Enable S3 API logging through CloudTrail
- **Config Rules:** Set up AWS Config rules for compliance monitoring
- **GuardDuty:** Enable GuardDuty for threat detection
