# üåü Task 3 - Create VPC Using Terraform

## üìå Task Description

The **Nautilus DevOps team** is strategizing the migration of a portion of their infrastructure to the **AWS cloud**. Recognizing the scale of this undertaking, they have opted to approach the migration in incremental steps rather than as a single massive transition. To achieve this, they have segmented large tasks into smaller, more manageable units.

This granular approach enables the team to execute the migration in gradual phases, ensuring smoother implementation and minimizing disruption to ongoing operations. By breaking down the migration into smaller tasks, the Nautilus DevOps team can systematically progress through each stage, allowing for better control, risk mitigation, and optimization of resources throughout the migration process.

**Requirements:**
- Create a VPC named **`nautilus-vpc`**
- Deploy in region **`us-east-1`**
- Use any IPv4 CIDR block
- The Terraform working directory is **`/home/bob/terraform`**
- Create the **`main.tf`** file (do not create a different .tf file)

üëâ **Your task:** Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) using Terraform to establish the foundational network infrastructure for the Nautilus application migration.

üí° **Note:** This VPC will serve as the isolated network environment for future AWS resources in the migration process.

## üîß Infrastructure Overview

**Target Environment:** AWS Cloud (us-east-1 region)
**Provider:** AWS (Amazon Web Services)
**Resources:** 
- AWS VPC with custom IPv4 CIDR block
- Network isolation for application resources
- Foundation for subnet and security group deployment

**Working Directory:** `/home/bob/terraform`

---

## üìã Solution Overview

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Components
- **VPC Resource:** Creates an isolated virtual network in AWS
- **IPv4 CIDR Block:** Defines the IP address range for the VPC (10.0.0.0/16)
- **Resource Tagging:** Proper naming convention for resource identification
- **Regional Deployment:** Deployed specifically in us-east-1 region

### üéØ Implementation Strategy
1. Define VPC resource with appropriate CIDR block
2. Configure proper naming through tags
3. Use standard private IP range for internal networking
4. Ensure resource is properly tagged for management

---

## üöÄ Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Navigate to Working Directory
```bash
cd /home/bob/terraform
```

**Purpose:** Ensure we're working in the correct Terraform directory as specified in the requirements.

---

### Step 2: Create Main Terraform Configuration

Create the `main.tf` file with the complete solution:
```hcl
# main.tf

# Create VPC for Nautilus infrastructure
resource "aws_vpc" "nautilus_vpc" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
  
  tags = {
    Name = "nautilus-vpc"
  }
}
```

**Configuration Breakdown:**
- `aws_vpc` - Creates a Virtual Private Cloud in AWS
- `cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"` - Defines IP address range (65,536 IP addresses)
- `tags` - Assigns the required name "nautilus-vpc" for identification

---

### Step 3: Initialize Terraform
```bash
terraform init
```

**Purpose:** Initialize the Terraform working directory and download the AWS provider.

**Expected Output:**
```
Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding latest version of hashicorp/aws...
- Installing hashicorp/aws v5.20.0...
- Using previously-installed hashicorp/aws v5.20.0

Terraform has been successfully initialized!
```

---

### Step 4: Format and Validate Configuration
```bash
# Format the configuration
terraform fmt

# Validate the configuration
terraform validate
```

**Purpose:** Ensure code formatting consistency and validate syntax correctness.

**Expected Output:**
```
Success! The configuration is valid.
```

---

### Step 5: Plan and Apply Configuration
```bash
# Review the execution plan
terraform plan

# Apply the configuration
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_vpc.nautilus_vpc will be created
  + resource "aws_vpc" "nautilus_vpc" {
      + arn                                  = (known after apply)
      + cidr_block                          = "10.0.0.0/16"
      + default_network_acl_id              = (known after apply)
      + default_route_table_id              = (known after apply)
      + default_security_group_id           = (known after apply)
      + dhcp_options_id                     = (known after apply)
      + enable_dns_hostnames                = false
      + enable_dns_support                  = true
      + enable_network_address_usage_metrics = false
      + id                                  = (known after apply)
      + instance_tenancy                    = "default"
      + ipv6_association_id                 = (known after apply)
      + ipv6_cidr_block                     = (known after apply)
      + ipv6_cidr_block_network_border_group = (known after apply)
      + main_route_table_id                 = (known after apply)
      + owner_id                            = (known after apply)
      + tags                                = {
          + "Name" = "nautilus-vpc"
        }
      + tags_all                            = {
          + "Name" = "nautilus-vpc"
        }
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue 1: CIDR block conflicts**
- **Symptoms:** Error: "InvalidVpc.Range: The CIDR 'x.x.x.x/x' conflicts with another subnet"
- **Solution:** Choose a different CIDR block or check existing VPCs
```bash
# List existing VPCs and their CIDR blocks
aws ec2 describe-vpcs --query 'Vpcs[*].[VpcId,CidrBlock,State]' --output table
```

**Issue 2: VPC limit exceeded**
- **Symptoms:** Error: "VpcLimitExceeded: The maximum number of VPCs has been reached"
- **Solution:** Delete unused VPCs or request limit increase
```bash
# Check VPC usage
aws ec2 describe-vpcs --query 'length(Vpcs)'
# Default limit is 5 VPCs per region
```

**Issue 3: Insufficient permissions**
- **Symptoms:** Error: "UnauthorizedOperation: You are not authorized to perform this operation"
- **Solution:** Ensure AWS credentials have EC2 VPC permissions
```bash
# Required permissions:
# - ec2:CreateVpc
# - ec2:DescribeVpcs
# - ec2:CreateTags
```

**Issue 4: Region mismatch**
- **Symptoms:** VPC created in wrong region
- **Solution:** Explicitly set AWS region
```bash
# Set region via environment variable
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1

# Or add provider block to main.tf
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}
```
